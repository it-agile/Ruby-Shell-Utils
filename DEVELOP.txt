PREREQUISITE FOR DEVELOPING
===========================
To develop the shell_utils, you need the bundler gem. This usually means you have to install it with
   sudo gem install bundler
(sudo is needed on OSX with the ruby provided by Apple. In other cases - e.g. if you are on another platform or are using rvm you may omit sudo if you wish to install the gem just for the current user.)

After installing the bundler gem call
  bundle install
to install all needed gems

COMMON TASKS WHEN DEVELOPING
============================
Create a new gem of the shell_utils and push it to RubyGems.org 
   build_gem.sh

Install the latest shell_utils from RubyGems.org
   sudo gem install shell_utils
